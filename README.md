# Pixel Art Maker Project

A single-page app in JavaScript where the user can create Artistic designs on a customizable canvas

## Purpose
 * To determine the Overall progress in the ALC program and identify the top 150learners from thie track
 * To test the skills learned by learners and certify the top learners at the end of the program

A starter code was given, including HTML and CSS, to build the application. Then I wrote the JavaScript code that lets the user to create a grid of squares representing their design, and apply colors to those squares to create a digital masterpiece!

The users would be able to:

    * Dynamically set the size of the table as an N by M grid.
    * Choose a color.
    * Click a cell in the grid to fill that cell with the chosen color.
